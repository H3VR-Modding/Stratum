# Stratum
Stratum is a lite stage and asset management framework, designed with [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io) in mind. Combined with [Mason](https://github.com/H3VR-Modding/Mason), they are an evolution of the pre-Thunderstore asset management framework, [Deli](https://github.com/Deli-Collective/Deli).
